  |   Prepare for the ultimate dinosaur-themed adventure - now you can      |
  |   take your tribe anywhere, at home or on the go! Stranded on a         |
  |   mysterious prehistoric island, you must explore its vast biomes as    |
  |   you begin to hunt, harvest, craft tools, grow crops and build         |
  |   shelters to survive. Use cunning and skill to kill, tame, breed,      |
  |   and even ride dinosaurs and other primitive beasts living on "The     |
  |   ARK." Advance your technology from primitive stone tools to           |
  |   T-Rex-mounted laser cannons, as you group up with thousands of        |
  |   players online or enjoy a solo Jurassic experience.                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Enjoy the new Single Player Settings mode in ARK, which speeds up     |
  |   earning XP, crafting, taming dinos and more. The overall difficulty   |
  |   of the game is also altered for solo players, and with these new      |
  |   settings, setting out for a single-player adventure in the world of   |
  |   ARK is a smoother and more enjoyable experience for players who       |
  |   prefer to go it alone!                                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Capture and Tame Dinosaurs: Discover over 100 different dinosaurs   |
  |     and prehistoric creatures on the island, finding ways to tame       |
  |     them into useful additions for your tribe's dino herd               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Survive Above All: Hunger, thirst, basic safety, and protecting     |
  |     yourself from the weather are all part of the game Harvest, Hunt    |
  |     and Build: Cut down trees and turn them into a basic home, which    |
  |     you can quickly expand into a Jurassic estate. Hunt for meat,       |
  |     scavenge for plants (or start your own garden!)                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Customize Everything: An extensive crafting system invites you to   |
  |     mix and match materials scavenged from the island, while also       |
  |     modifying the colors, textures, shapes, and styles                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Explore the Island: Solve the mystery of The ARK as you explore     |
  |     this massive island, discovering Explorer's Notebooks (filled       |
  |     with clues!) throughout                                             |
